# FunkyStats

[FunkyStats](https://funkystats.netlify.app) is an FRC data analytics tool that utilizes FSM, the Funky Scoring Metric, to make highly accurate predictions of teams' in-match performance.

### Why FSM?

- Predicts a team's scoring capabilities to within fractions of a cycle, verified with scouting data
- The game-specific match prediction model contributes to an accuracy higher than Statbotics
- Responsive to sudden improvements in robot performance
- Leans towards a team's better and later matches for a better estimate of their scoring capabilities

### TODOs

- [ ] Finish implementation of match prediction model
- [ ] Add RP predictions
- [ ] Add event simulations`
